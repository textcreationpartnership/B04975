            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>REPLYS for the preſent Magiſtrates of the Burgh of <hi>Irving,</hi> to the Anſwers made to their Complaint, given into the Lord High-Commiſſioner his Grace, and the Estates of Parliament, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the late Magistrates of the ſaid Burgh.</head>
            <p>THE Subſtance of the Complaint given in by the preſent Magiſtrats of the Town of <hi>Irving,</hi> againſt the late Magiſtrats; being ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently repeated in the Anſwers Printed by theſe late Magiſtrats, their own Defence. Its evident, that the complaint of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Magiſtrats proceeds upon four moſt juſt grounds, <hi>viz.</hi> 1ſt. That Gift procured by theſe late Magiſtrats, of two Merks per Boll of Malt Browen and Vented within the Burgh, was, and is now found by the Claim of Right, to have been an illegal Impoſition.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That it was procured by theſe late Magiſtats, who were in Effect no lawful Magiſtrates, but were impoſed upon the Burgh, by Letters from King <hi>James,</hi> impetrat to themſelves, contrary to the Liberties thereof.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That the Gift was taken up from the Perſons who were Agents for it, after the Burgh had by two ſeveral Acts, <hi>viz.</hi> One of the 23, and Another of the 27 of <hi>October</hi> 1688, a few days before the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi>'s Landing, recalled the Money which was appointed to be payed for the ſaid Gift, and had ordained it to be applyed for better Uſes; So that the Gift was not brought Weſt to the Burgh, nor approven by its Counſel, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the thirteenth of <hi>November,</hi> after the Prince was certainly Arrived.</p>
            <p>And 4. That ſeeing the Gift it ſelf was Illegal, the Procurers thereof, no Lawful Magiſtrats, but Men impoſed by Arbitrary Letters, and the Money, the Price thereof, clearly recalled. The Burgh ought to be exonered of the Debt of 5000 Merks by them contracted, and the Debt declared to be their perſonal Debt, and not the Debt of the Burgh.</p>
            <p>Which grounds being in themſelves clear and concludent, all that's An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered by the late Magiſtrats in their Printed Anſwers, is of little moment; and becauſe it would prove tedious to reſume all the idle Stories contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in their Print, the Heads thereof ſhall here be Noticed and Anſwered in their order. And firſt, they ſay, That they were not impoſed upon the Town for Magiſtrats, by the late Arbitrary Power, becauſe they had no acceſſion to their own Nomination, and durſt not refuſe when Nominat, leſt they had been reached by ſome of theſe Stretches that were ordinar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly then made uſe of againſt thoſe of that Countrey. To which it is An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, That the deſign and manner of theſe Court-Nominations, are but
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:176035:2"/>too well known, and too plainly marked by the Declaration of the Eſtates, for men to offer ſuch an Excuſe, there being nothing more certain, than that in all <hi>Scotland,</hi> the men pitched upon, were ſuch as did both officiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly impetrat theſe Letters for themſelves, and were alſo choſen by the Court, as the men moſt proper for their Deſigns: So that for theſe late Magiſtrats, who did impetrat the Letters in their own favours, as appears by their Precepts of Twenty Seven Pounds <hi>Sterling,</hi> drawn for to pay for them, and are alſo deſigned in them to be men moſt loyal and ready to promote the King's Service. To alledge, either that they had no acceſſion to their own Nomination, or that they were in hazard if they refuſed of the Stretches then ordinarly made uſe of againſt that Countrey, are equally Calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious. But,</p>
            <p n="2">2ly. As to the Gift it ſelf, they ſay, they did, as other Towns had done, and were amongſt the laſt that procured ſuch Gifts, and that they procured this Gift for the good of the Town, and with the conſent of Neighbours, and even of ſome of thoſe that are now in the Magiſtracy. To which it is Anſwered, That whatever example theſe late Magiſtrats may pretend, it was undoubtedly <hi>in re illicita,</hi> where examples are of no force. And as to the alledged Conſent of Neighbours, it is ſo great a Falſhood, that it's offered to be proven, that the Neighbours did both Diſſent and Oppoſe, and actually Collected Money, and ſent one to <hi>Edinburgh</hi> for that effect; but theſe pretended Magiſtrats were ſo earneſt for this Impoſition, that when they heard that the Neighbours had met, and had named one <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Thomſon</hi> to collect the Money, to bear the charge of their oppoſing the Gift, <hi>Robert Wallace</hi> one of the then Baillies committed him to Priſon; nor is there any more truth in what they affirm of ſome of the preſent Magiſtrats, as Approvres of their courſe.</p>
            <p n="3">3. They ſay, that it appears by the Date of the Gift, that it was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured long before His Majeſty came to <hi>Britain:</hi> But its Anſwered, That whatever may be the date of the Gift, yet it is evident, from the Town Councils Acts, that upon the 27th of <hi>October</hi> 1688, they heard nothing of its being procured, but recalled their Money that ſhould have been gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven for the Price of it; Which Order, they were in <hi>peſſima fidae</hi> after that day to alter, eſpecially ſince His Majeſties Declaration was then Print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and Publiſhed, wherein he complains, both of the undue impoſing of Magiſtrats upon Burghs, and of the giving of Gifts of Money without Act of Parliament: But the moſt probable Account of the matter ſeems to be, that the Gift was indeed procured at Court before, but the Price not fully agreed, and that ſo it ſtood, till His Majeſty was arrived in <hi>England:</hi> And then the Gift being nothing worth, a ſimulat Purchaſe was the more eaſily made, and the Burgh cheated of its Money, which by an Act only three Weeks before they had recalled, and applyed to better Uſes.</p>
            <p n="4">4. They ſay, that theſe late Magiſtrats, were truly Magiſtrates accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the faſhion of the time, and what they did, they did for the good of the Burgh, and that they changed their Orders the 23, and 27 of <hi>Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi> for recalling of the Money; Becauſe, when theſe that were ſent, came to <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> they found the Gift was lying there waiting for them, and ſo they were obliged to take it, and pay for it, according to the former Agreement.</p>
            <p>To which its Anſwered, 1. What Magiſtrates the late Magiſtrates were,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:176035:2"/>hath been already ſhown. 2. To bring an Impoſition upon the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of the Burgh againſt their mind, and to their manifeſt Oppreſſion, can never be judged for the good of the Burgh. But 3. What plainer Diſcovery can be made, of the indirect dealing that hath been in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, than what is here acknowledged, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Town knew not of the procuring of the Gift upon the 27 of <hi>October,</hi> when His Majeſties De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration was abroad, and the News of his Arrival every hour expected, and that yet thereafter, the Men ſent to bring back the Towns Money, ſhould have been ſo ſimple, as to give away the Money againſt the Towns Orders, for a Gift that no man at that time did value worth a Groat.</p>
            <p>But the truth is, That theſe Magiſtrats having come in by the late King <hi>James</hi>'s Letter, without the Good-Will or Conſent of the Burgh, did from the beginning, deſign only their own Advantage; and therefore againſt the mind of the Neighbours reſolved to borrow Money, and no leſs than 5000 Merks, to purchaſe an Impoſition, whereof they hoped to get the Management; and this Deſign they purſued, until the appearance of the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> quite ſpoiled their Hope, and then indeed they recalled their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney from <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> but yet with an unreaſonable allowance of 500 Merks to <hi>Robert Wallace</hi> one of their Baillies, for the bare pretence of the Expences he had been at; and further, not herewith Content, afterwards when they they found the Gift was come that they had loſt hope of, and when they knew it to be of no value, they have the confidence to pretend, that they gave the Money for it, without regard to their own Act of Council, which then ſtood, and ſtill ſtands unrepelled.</p>
            <p>By all which it is evident, that the Burgh ought to be declared free of the ſaids Bonds given for the Money to be payed for the ſaid Gift, and that the Magiſtrats who pretends to have given the ſame, <hi>qua tales &amp; ratione of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficii,</hi> ſhould be declared to be perſonally lyable therefore, ſeing it were an imbazleing without parallel, that men who were indeed no Magiſtrats ſhould be allowed to bring Burden upon a Burgh for a meer Sham-Gift, which they had never any ground to ſeek, and were moſt free to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed, as wholly uſeleſs and unprofitable to the Burgh, and the Creditors who contracted with them, were neither ignorant that they were but im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed Magiſtrats, nor could they but know the end and uſe for which the Money was borrowed.</p>
            <p>And to make it further Evident, how little Reaſon there is, that the Town be liable for this Debt of 5000 Merks, needleſsly contracted, and fooliſhly imbazled by theſe impoſed Magiſtrates. Its offered to be proven, That it was the ancient Cuſtome of the ſaid Burgh of <hi>Irving,</hi> that no Debt could be Lawfully Contracted by their Magiſtrates, to burden the Burgh, unleſs the Neighbourhood had been called, and the conſent of the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie obtained to it, which Cuſtome was ſo conſtant, that the ſame was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo obſerved in the diſcharging of their Theſauries Accounts. And as to this very particular, it may be inſtanced in the Town of <hi>Dumfreis,</hi> how the Provoſt thereof for the time, (tho a Papiſt,) when he had the like Gift for his Burgh in his offer, yet he firſt called the Community, and becauſe they Diſſented, would meddle no further with it. By all which its manifeſt, that the foreſaids Magiſtrats ought to be perſonally liable to theſe Credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors from whom they borrowed the Money, and that the Burgh and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity thereof, ought to be exonoured of the ſame for ever.</p>
